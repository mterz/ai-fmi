1. Running the program.
The program is written in Javascript. There are some ES6 features in the code.
To test it you should have at least version 6.4 of node installed. Latest version is recommended.
Then type "npm install" in the terminal when you are located in the directory of the project.
That is needed to download all 3rd party modules used. Then type "node app.js" to run the app.
It expects numbers: W, N - maxWeight and numberOfItems and then to enter weight/value for each of the N elements.
There are some testing examples in the code if you want to uncomment them.

2. Structure of the program.
We use genetic algorithm to find a good solution of the knapsack problem.

3. Time.
The algorithms finds a solution relatively fast.
