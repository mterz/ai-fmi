# Problem

Read the data from `iris.txt` and split it in two sets
* testing - 20 elements, chosen randomly
* learning - the rest of the elements

Implement the kNearestNeighbours algorithm
* k - input parameter
* to predicts the class of the elements from the testing set

Print
* predicted classes of the training set
* accuracy

# Running the program

* Go to the directory of the project
* Run `npm install`
* Run `node app.js`
* Enter K - the number of Eucleadean neighbours to the testing point, which determine what the class is

# Structure of the program

We use the k-nearest-neighbours(KNN) algorithm to predict the classes of the Iris flowers from the testing set.
